# The purpose of the work
To practice knowledge:
- how to create animations between components;
- creating animations for screen elements;
- the use of ready-made animations.

# What needs to be done
Continue to refine the QUIZ application that you started in previous models. At this stage, you need to add animations for transitions between fragments and animations for screen elements.

The procedure of actions:

1. Add animations of transitions between fragments on the "Welcome", "Survey", and "Results" screens. You need to add at least two custom animations and describe them in xml files. You can use any animation framework (animator, animation, transition).
2. Add a Ripple animation for the Start button on the Welcome screen.
3. Add an animation of the appearance of elements (changing transparency from 0 to 1) for any elements on the Survey screen.
4. Add any animation for at least two elements on the results screen using ObjectAnimator (or other animator classes). You can use xml or kotlin code to describe animations.
5. Add any finished animation using Lottie to the Results screen.
