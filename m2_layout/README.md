# The purpose of the task.
Consolidate your knowledge of text fields and buttons.

# What needs to be done.
It is necessary to develop a small counter application for counting passengers entering the bus. The application should look something like this:

- Pressing the "+" and "-" buttons changes the value of the counter and test fields to "+1" and "-1", respectively. You cannot set a value less than 0.
- The Reset button not only resets the counter, but also returns the application to its original state (screenshot 1).
- There are 49 seats on the bus. We want to send buses as full as possible, but we must not exceed them. Too many passengers is a reason for immediate departure. 
- If all the seats are free, the text in the middle is green, the "â€”" button is unavailable.
- When the number of passengers is from 1 to 49, the text is blue, the buttons are available. The Reset button is invisible.
- When the number of passengers is 50 and above, the text is red, the "Reset" button appears.
