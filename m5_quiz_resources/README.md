# The purpose of the practical work.
Apply knowledge:
- to create and add resources,
- to configure the AndroidManifest file,
- to connect gradle dependencies.

# What needs to be done
Practical work is the first stage in creating a small QUIZ application that you will be working on for several modules.

At this stage, you are provided with an application template with logic, resources and an archive with files artifacts.zip . You need to finalize the project: change some parameters, import resources and configure dependencies. 

1. Come up with a meaningful name for the application and change its app_name in string resources.
2. Set the minSdk parameter so that it corresponds to the Android 7.0 version.
3. Change the applicationId to an option that better matches the name of your application.
4. Add the current and stable version of the android.material library to the gradle dependencies.
5. Connect the View Binding function to the project.
6. Add a new application icon using the icon configurator.
7. Change the colors in the main theme of the application.
8. Create a Font directory, add an Opensans font group from the archive file and install this font for the text in the main theme of the application.
9. Add two WAV music files from the archive to the project. Select the appropriate directory for this.
10. Add the Internet connection permission in your manifest file.
11. Create the first screen in the application â€” the user's welcome screen, from which he will already go to the main quiz screen. On the welcome screen (if you created a project from the Empty Views Activity template, then this will be the only screen of your application at the moment), add the image of the welcome_picture (archived in SVG vector format) and the "Continue" button.
