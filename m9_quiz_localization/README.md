# What needs to be done
We continue to improve our QUIZ application. 

At this stage, take the project from the previous work as a basis.

1. Add a button to the previous welcome screen layout, where you ask the user to enter his date of birth. By clicking on the button, show the DatePicker. 
2. Hang the "listener" on it and count the entered date. 
3. After confirming the selection, use the formatter to convert the date to a human-oriented view, for example 03.01.22.
4. Show the formatted date in the Snackbar (as in the example from the video).
5. Translate the application into English. Russian Russian localization To do this, create a separate Russian localization and add all the lines in Russian there, and in the default locale, translate all the lines into English.
6. Check that everything is working correctly. To do this, change the system language in the phone settings.
