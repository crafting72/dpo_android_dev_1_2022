# The purpose of the practical work
Apply the knowledge of Permissions and learn how to work with the camera.



# What needs to be done
You will have to write a mini-application "Sights". The application should consist of two screens: a list of photos and a photo creation. 

1. Create a database using Room.
2. Declare as a model an entity containing the path to the file with the photo and the date of the snapshot.
3. Place a button on the photo list screen to go to the snapshot creation screen.
4. Save the captured image to the database.
5. Display the pictures taken with the dates on the list screen.
