# The goals of practical work
- Apply the knowledge of working with the network in Android.
- Work with the REST API using the Retrofit library.


# What needs to be done
Create an application to download and display user data. The interface should also have an "Update" button, which will download new data from a random user and display it on the screen.

1. Create an application and initialize the Retrofit library in it.
2. Try to run the query https://randomuser.me/api / in the browser and define the fields that come in response.
3. Describe the user's data model according to the data from the query.
4. Create a random user data download request for Retrofit.
5. Set up the screen with the necessary fields.
6. Add the initial initialization of the screen â€” when launching the application, the user should immediately see the result of the program.
7. Add the "Restart" button, when clicked, the application updates the data on the screen.
8. Add the Glide library for uploading images. To do this, you need to familiarize yourself with the instructions for connection and use.
