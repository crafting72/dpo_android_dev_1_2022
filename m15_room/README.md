# The purpose of the practical work
Apply knowledge of DB, SQL and Room.



# What needs to be done
Write a mini application for counting words. The interface should allow you to add a new word to the dictionary, view the list of the first words in the dictionary, search for the number of matches, and also clear the application data.

1. Create a database using Room.
2. As a model, it is necessary to declare an entity containing a word (it is also used as a key) and the number of its repetitions.
3. Add TextInput and the "Add" button to the main screen. By clicking on it, we must either add a new word to the dictionary (if it does not occur), or increase the repetition counter by one.
4. Subscribe to the table update using flow. Add a text field to the screen where the first five words that occur will be displayed.
5. Add the "Clear" button, clicking on which would delete all data from the database.
6. Add a word input check. It is necessary to block the addition of empty lines and words containing spaces, numbers, dots and commas (only letters and hyphens are allowed). When the user tries to add such a combination, display the corresponding message on the screen.
