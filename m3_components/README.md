# The purpose of the work.
Practice applying knowledge of the basic ViewGroup.

# What needs to be done.
Create a CustomView based on an example template of a post on a social network (see the picture), using knowledge about the ViewGroup.

The layout should be indented (all indents in the 16dp layout).

CustomView should be embedded in main_activity.xml and displayed when the application is launched.

The texts inside the "Top Row" and "Bottom Row" widgets must be configured from the MainActivity code. For example: from the MainActivity code, configure the CustomView so that it displays "top line configured from code", "bottom line configured from code".
