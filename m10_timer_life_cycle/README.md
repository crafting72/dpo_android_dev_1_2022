# The purpose of the practical work
Apply knowledge on the application lifecycle and state retention when changing the configuration.

# What needs to be done
Refine the stopwatch application from module 4:

1. After starting the stopwatch and turning the screen, the stopwatch should continue counting.
2. After the countdown has ended, when you turn the screen, it should not start again.
3. All views should remain in the same state they were in before the screen was rotated (the SeekBar/Slider is locked/unlocked and its position has not changed, the button displays the correct action).
